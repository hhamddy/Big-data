Wat is Big data?
Big data refers to the large, diverse sets of information that grow at ever-increasing rates.
 It encompasses the volume of information, the velocity or speed at which it is created and collected, and the variety or scope of the data points being covered. 
Big data often comes from multiple sources and arrives in multiple formats.
The Uses of Big Data..
Data analysts look at the relationship between different types of data, such as demographic data and purchase history, to determine whether a correlation exists. 
Such assessments may be done in-house within a company or externally by a third-party who focuses on processing big data into digestible formats.
 Businesses often use the assessment of big data by such experts to turn it into actionable information.
Nearly every department in a company can utilize findings from data analysis, from human resources and technology to marketing and sales.
 The goal of big data is to increase the speed at which products get to market, to reduce the amount of time and resources required to gain market adoption
  target audiences, and to ensure that customers remain satisfied.
